# Database Queries  
For a provided sample entered manually in the `Database Query` or sample(s) uploaded from a batch file (Batch Database Query tab)
`STR Similarity` will generate a report that includes the similarity scores (described below) as computed against a database of known STR profiles.  
</p>
The report will differ depending on if an individual sample or batch of samples is provided.   

### Database information
Data underlying the database were provided by ..... `TO BE FILLED LATER AS DATABASE IS MADE.`   

---

### Individual Sample Report
For individual samples, a report is generated with the following fields.

| Output Field | Description |
| :--- |    :----   |
| Mixed Sample      | Flag to indicate sample mixing. Sample mixing is determined by the "'Mixed' Sample Threshold" option. If more markers are tri+ allelic than the threshold, samples are flagged as potentially mixed. |
| Shared Markers   | Number of markers shared between the query and database sample. |
| Shared Alleles   | Number of alleles shared between the query and database sample. |
| Tanabe Score | Tanabe similarity score between the query and database sample. |
| Master Query Score | Master 'Query' similarity score between the query and database sample. |
| Master Ref Score | Master 'Reference' similarity score between the query and database sample. |

---

### Batch Sample Report 
For batched samples, a report is summary report is generated. For individual sample comparison report, enter the individual sample in the database query tab.

| Output Field | Description |
| :---        |    :----   |
| Mixed Sample | Flag to indicate sample mixing. Sample mixing is determined by the "'Mixed' Sample Threshold" option. If more markers are tri+ 
| Top Match |	Name and Tanabe score of top match to sample. |
| Next Best Match |	Name and Tanabe score of next best match to sample. |
| Tanabe Matches | Name and Tanabe score of matches above scoring threshold to sample. |
| Master Query Matches | Name and Masters (vs. query) score of matches above scoring threshold to sample. |
| Master Ref Matches | Name and Masters (vs. reference) score of matches above scoring threshold to sample. |

# Non-database Queries
For batch samples entered in the File Query tab, `STR Similarity` will generate a report that mirrors the batch query above, except that samples will be queried against each other rather than against the database.

# Query Options

### All fields

* Amelogenin is included in the score computation by default but can be excluded by de-selecting option.
* 'Mixed' Sample Threshold

### Batch and file specfic

* Tanabe Filter Threshold: is the Tanabe score threshold over which a sample is considered a match in batch and file queries. 
* Masters (vs. query) Filter Threshold: is the Masters (vs. query) score threshold over which a sample is considered a match in batch and file queries.
* Masters (vs. reference) Filter Threshold: is the Masters (vs. reference) score threshold over which a sample is considered a match in batch and file queries.
